                                Hi, my name is Stanisław Anioła and I am looks like the one on the left side; ok, maybe not exactly same but we have some common characteristics :)
                    
                    I am very exited to be your host here; Now, let me tell about where are we... so, the site that you are seeing is a simple blog. We can add posts and comment and then update and delete them. Ofcourse right now it is not so practical because, anyone can post posts as anyone, so... yea. I just wanted to try build something from scratch as I did. Anyway, I am very proud of my self :) There is so much stuff that I learned during building this site, and I will be able to reuse them in nearby future :)
